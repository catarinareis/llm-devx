# LLM-DevX 🧠💻  
**Exploring the Impact of Large Language Models on Developer Experience**

This repository supports work, talks, and research on how Large Language Models (LLMs) reshape the Developer Experience (DevX). 
<!-- It includes slides, insights, experiments, and code samples related to my conference presentations and evolving explorations. -->

## 📌 About This Project

**LLM-DevX** was launched following my talk "Exploring the Potential of LLMs in the SDLC: A Productivity Perspective" at [JNation](https://jnation.pt/) on May 27 & 28, 2025. The talk focused on how LLMs are transforming:

- Developer productivity
- Tooling and development environments
- Perceptions of what it means to “develop software”

This repo will continue to grow as a hub for ideas, frameworks, audience feedback, and practical experiments on these themes.
